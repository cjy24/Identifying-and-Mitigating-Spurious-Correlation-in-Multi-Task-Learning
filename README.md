# Identifying-and-Mitigating-Spurious-Correlation-in-Multi-Task-Learning

Multi-task learning (MTL) is a paradigm that aims to improve the generalization of models by simultaneously learning multiple related tasks, leveraging shared representations and task-specific information to enhance performance on individual tasks. However, existing work has shown that MTL can potentially hinder generalization, with one key factor being spurious correlations between tasks. Owing to the knowledge-sharing property, the per-task predictors are more likely to develop reliance on spurious features. Most existing approaches address this issue through distributional robustness, aiming to maintain consistent performance across different distributions under unknown covariate shifts. However, this formulation lacks theoretical guarantees and can be sensitive to the construction of covariate shifts. In this work, we propose a novel perspective, where we seek to identify spurious correlations between tasks. Drawing inspirations from conventional formulations on spurious correlation, for each task, we propose to distinguish its spurious tasks using the difference in correlation coefficients between the empirical distribution and class-wise resampled distributions, thereby capturing the correlations between task labels w.r.t. each class. We prove theoretically the feasibility of the resampling strategy in characterizing spurious correlations between tasks. Furthermore, we propose a simple fine-tuning strategy, \textbf{debiased adversarial training}, where the per-task predictors are adversarially trained to disregard information associated with their spurious tasks. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in improving generalization.
